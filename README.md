The project on "Recommended exploration of the music space" leverages the scraping of music path obtained by following the recommender systems of Spotify, which is freely available through API. These paths will then be analyzed and compared to assess the impact of the recommender system (RS) on the exploration. A popular theory states that recommenders tend to push us into the so-called echo chambers, i.e. semantic spaces corresponding to our comfort zone (i.e. for music the songs we already like), discouraging the discovery of new and, more importantly, different things. Of course, this could happen in all the systems where RS are involved, leading also to political segregation and extremism.
